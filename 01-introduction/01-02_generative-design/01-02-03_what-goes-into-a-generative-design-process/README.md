# What Goes Into a Generative Design Process?

## Stages

As previously discussed, generative design allows for a more integrated workflow between human and computer. This workflow involves the following stages: _`generative`_,_`analyze`_,_`rank`_,_`evolve`_,_`explore`_, and _`integrate`_.

### Generate

This is the stage where design options are created or generated by the system, using algorithms and parameters specified by the designer.

### Analyze

Here, the designs generated in the previous step are now measured or analyzed based on how well they achieve goals defined by the designer.

### Rank

Then, the design options are ordered or ranked based on the results of the analysis.

### Evolve

In this stage, the process ranks the design options to figure out which direction they should be further developed or evolved into.

### Explore

After which the designer compares and explores the generated designs, inspecting both the geometry and evaluation results.

### Integrate

And finally, after choosing a favorite design option, the designer uses or integrates this design into the wider project or design work.
