# Computational Design

#### What is Computational design? 

**Computational design** is not any one algorithm or off-the-shelf process you can apply. Rather, we describe it as an approach whereby a designer defines a series of **instructions, rules,** and **relationships** that precisely identify the steps necessary to achieve a proposed design and the resulting data or geometry. Crucially, these steps must be computable, meaning they can be understood and calculated by a machine.

Put simply, computers are very good at **performing calculations** and **executing pre-defined steps.**

When approaching a design computationally, the designer would focus on developing the procedure that would create a design, and not the design itself. The process of iterating through options and data are offloaded to a machine. This saves time, money, effort, and lets the designer focus on the creativity of the design process.
