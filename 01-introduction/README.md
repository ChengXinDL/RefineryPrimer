We will look at the following topics:

* The fundamental concepts needed to understand generative design.
* A definition of generative design in the context of AEC.
* An introduction to Generative Design for Revit and Dynamo.
* Examples of using generative design to solve design problems.
* Common approaches used.
* Related concepts.

Let’s start by looking at something you’re very likely to be aware of and already using today: computational design.
