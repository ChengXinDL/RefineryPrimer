# Anatomy of a good Generative Design Process

## Define your problem, sketch it out
*	Can you write down your design steps? Generally, if you can define concrete steps it is easier to create a computational model
*	Are you generating geometry? [Generators could be whole chapter]
*	Are you measuring or analyzing something? [Evaluators could be whole chapter]
*	What key result do you want out? What kind of decision will you be trying to make?

## Define inputs & outputs
*	what are the constants and variables in your problem?
*	what are you trying to measure?

## How do you measure which option is best?
Having precise rules for evaluation is critical for generative design to be successful. Without anything to evaluate, the generative process will produce a random and arbitrary set of designs which may not be of any use to a designer at all.

Adding evaluation criteria to a computational process makes it more complex, but also more realistic and relevant to the designer’s needs. Adding evaluation conditions that say “make the largest table possible” and “use the fewest materials possible” make the model complex (there is now an unavoidable trade-off that must be considered) but also directly target what the designer is most interested in (a big table at minimum cost). Algorithms perform best  when these conditions are layered on top of each other and a solution that balances them must be found.

## Results
How do you want to review the results?
Who is the target audience and what do you want them to decide on?
What do you want to do with the results?

## Solve it once
Solve it once by flexing the dynamo graph
Are the results aligned with what you would expect?

## Run an optioneering process
## Run an optimisation process
