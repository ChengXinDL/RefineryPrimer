## Setting up your graph for Refinery
To set up your Dynamo graph for Refinery right-click on each node used to drive the graph and ensure that the “Is Input” option is ticked. Renaming the node with a standard approach such as IN_description will help to distinguish these inputs in Refinery.  

(Note: currently all inputs must be number slider nodes)

To define outputs in Refinery, right-click on the watch nodes and select the “Is Output” option. Renaming the node with a standard approach such as OUT_description will help to distinguish these outputs in Refinery. 

(Note: currently all outputs must be watch nodes with a data type of Number).

Once both inputs and outputs are correctly set up, Refinery can be launched. In Dynamo navigate to the toolbar and select View > Refinery… This will start the local Refinery server and a new window will open.
