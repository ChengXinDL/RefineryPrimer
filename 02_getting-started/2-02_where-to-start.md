# Where do you start?

The first thing to do is to have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve:
*	What do you want to design?
*	What are the design parameters?
*	What conditions must the design satisfy?
*	What must not be present in a final design?
*	What makes the design a success or a failure?
*	What would you like to maximise or minimise?
Answering these questions not only clarifies the problem at hand in the designer’s mind, but also helps break the problem into smaller components that will serve as inputs into the generative design process. The more precisely a user can answer these questions, the more relevant the outputs of a generative process will be.

Example
> Imagine you’ve been engaged by a client to design a school. You’d want to nail down precisely the site restrictions, number of students, total budget, and any other mission-critical requirements as soon as possible. Only through a thorough accounting of project objectives can the brief be fully defined. This is critically important in the present case, since a generative process cannot consider any goals that is has not been instructed to consider
