# Getting Started with Generative Techniques in your Design Process

The next question becomes; how can generative design principles be applied to real-world design processes? This chapter demonstrates the answer to this question for a series of common design challenges. 

It is not at all true that computational or generative design are only applicable in very complex design problems. In fact, once a designer has a computational design process set up, simple design questions can be solved with ease. You really can eliminate huge amounts of manual work from both easy and complex design problems.
