Optioneering involves creating design options that are not guided by outcomes while they are being created. Optioneering methods can be used to explore a design space quickly and when you might not know what metrics you want to optimize for yet.  After performing optioneering, the designer can sort and filter design variants to identify options that are particularly aligned with her design objectives. 

Consider the table example in [Section 1-05](#product-design). In the optioneering stage, a designer will browse through her set of designs and select those she likes most. Perhaps her selections are particularly eye-catching, perhaps they are ultra-lightweight and practical. Whatever the reason, she selects and sorts her most favoured options. She continues narrowing down her selections till she’s left with just a few. She then mixes and matches between these options – perhaps one table’s legs aren’t sturdy enough and should be swapped with those of another table that is just too narrow – until she finally gets to her final design. It’s this picking and choosing and mixing and matching that is the essence of optioneering. It helps a user find the best design of the bunch.
