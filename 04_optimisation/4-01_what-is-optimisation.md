Optimisation is an inherently mathematical subject. It is concerned with maximising or minimising some mathematical function to arrive at the best possible solution to a problem. Optimisation problems arise in all kinds of fields, from aerospace engineering to architectural design, but regardless of domain, every optimisation problem has three features: 

1. An objective function 
2. Constraints 
3. Data
