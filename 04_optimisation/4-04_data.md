# Data 
Data is the fundamental “stuff” you feed into your optimisation model, the inputs that the objective function and constraints act upon. 

In the financial world, data is the assets you can buy or sell and their prices. In the aerospace world, data is the unit weight and cost of carrying a certain kind of fuel. In design, data is the density or price of construction materials or even how many hours of sunlight a room can expect to receive in a day. The optimisation model takes all these as inputs and works to maximise or minimise with respect to them. 

Real-world optimisation problems are invariably solved algorithmically and there are often many algorithms to solve the same problem (several of which will be introduced below). The most common algorithm used in Generative Design is the Genetic Algorithm.
