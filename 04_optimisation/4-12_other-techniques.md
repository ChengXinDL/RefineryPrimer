# Are there examples of other techniques that could be used to solve this problem? 
There are many techniques that can be used to tackle a Computational Design problem. In addition to the genetic algorithm, other examples include: 

- Solving with pen and paper 
- Manual guess and check 
- Set packing or partitioning algorithms 
- Gradient descent  
- Stochastic Local Search 
- Linear, Integer, or Quadratic programming  

Some of these techniques are quite basic and easy to implement, others are far more sophisticated.  Choosing the right technique for your application is a tricky question and much more of an art than a science. Often, it comes down to the precise design question you are tackling and your familiarity with a given technique.
