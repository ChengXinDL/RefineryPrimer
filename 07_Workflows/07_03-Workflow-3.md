## Description

This Graph can be used with Dynamo Refinery to generate desk layouts on a floor plan. You can use Refinery to maximise the amount of desks placed while maintaining a larger area reserved for amenities. 

## Inputs

| Dynamo Input          | Input Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Floor plate              |  |
| Neighbourhood boundaries |  |
| Desk width               |  |
| Desk depth               |  |
| Back to back tolerance   |  |

| Refinery Input    | Input Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Boundaries start points |  |
| Boundaries end points   |  |

## Functions

The script is made up of a series of functions, which are divided into groups inside the graph. Each group has a name and a short description, where the name indicates the type of funciton that is being run and the description explains a bit more in detail the process.

## Visualization

All unnecesary geometry has been hidden from the graph in order to get a nice visual in the Refinery interface. Only [...] will be visible. The solar incision on the building is show [...] .This will make easy the task of visually going through the options generated by the graph. For a better understanding of the results, a series of context buildings have been inluded in the Revit sample file.

## Outputs

| Refinery Output   | Output Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Amenity space area |  |
| Number of desks    |  |

## Results

Once Refinery has finish running we can have a look at the outputs of the new study.
