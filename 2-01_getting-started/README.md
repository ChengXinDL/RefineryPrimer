# Getting Started with Generative Techniques in your Design Process

Now that we're familiar with what generative design is, why use it and seen some example use-cases, the next question becomes:

> how can generative design principles be applied to real-world design processes?

This chapter demonstrates the answer to this question for a series of common design challenges.

It's important to note that although it sounds complex, a generative design approach is not limited to only solving complex design problems. In fact, once a designer has a computational design process set up, generative design can help solve design questions with ease and eliminate huge amounts of manual work from both easy and complex design problems alike.
