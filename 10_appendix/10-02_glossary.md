# Generative Design Terminology
<br/>

**Computational design**
/ comp·u·ta·tion·al de·sign /
noun

> Explicit rules that systematically model the behavior of a proposed design and the resulting data and geometry. Little project data is kept as static objects, instead the procedure to create them is saved. Project geometry and data are generated from the execution of mathematical and logical procedures.
<br/>


**Generative design**
/ gen·er·a·tive de·sign /
noun

> A system that produces design studies (alternatives), evaluates them against quantiﬁable goals, improves studies by learning from previous, and ranks results based on their distance from the goals. The project is kept as a system, with affordances to choose one or a small subset of alternatives as a ﬁnal set of project data and geometry.
<br/>


**Generate** 
/ gen·er·ate / 
verb 

> To produce or create a design. Requires 1 or more input parameters which are combined in an algorithm to produce a design study. The resulting model or data is not necessarily a viable design.
<br/>


**Goal** 
/ goal / 
noun 

> A quantiﬁable target value or range for a project or feature of a project.
<br/>

**Evaluate** 
/ e·val·u·ate / 
verb 

> To judge the quality of something based on how well it performs in one or more objective functions. 
<br/>
 
**Evolve** 
/ e·vol·ve / 
verb 

> To gradually make something better over generations. 
<br/>
 
**Explore** 
/ ex·plore / 
verb 

> Different ways to interpret results and rankings.  
<br/>
 
**Solver** 
/ solv·er / 
nounthanks 

> An algorithm specifically designed to find the solution to a precisely defined problem.  
<br/>

**Seed** 
/ seed / 
noun 

> tbc 
<br/>

**Genetic** 
/ ge·net·ic / 
noun 

> tbc 
<br/>
 
**Algorithm** 
/ al·go·rithm / 
noun 

> tbc 
<br/>

**Iterative** 
/ it·er·a·tive / 
verb 

> Doing something repeatedly, often to make it better. 
<br/>

**Multi-objective** 
/ mul·ti ob·ject·ive / 
adjective 

> Using two or more objectives when optimising a solution. 
<br/>

**Optioneering** 
/ op·tion·eer·ing / 
verb 

> Describe a goal, define constraints and make the computer generate all possible solutions.  
<br/>
 
**Optimisation** 
/ op·ti·mi·sa·tion / 
verb 

> Maximising or minimising some mathematical function to arrive at the best possible solution to a problem. 
<br/>
 
**Permutation** 
/ per·mu·ta·tion / 
verb 

> tbc 
<br/>
 
**Cross-product** 
/ cross pro·duct / 
verb 

> tbc 
<br/>
 
**Local optimum** 
/ lo·cal op·ti·mum / 
verb 

> The best solution within a neighbourhood of solutions that are slightly different, but still worse than the global optimum.   
<br/>
 
**Global optimum** 
/ glo·bal op·ti·mum / 
verb 

> The most optimal solution out of all the possible solutions.
