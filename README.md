# The Generative Design Primer

## About
Welcome to the Generative Design Primer, which aims to introduce AEC practioners of all experience levels to the exciting field. This primer will help you:

* **Understand** what generative design is by defining the base concepts and terminology you need to know
* **Explore** how these techniques can be used to solve practical challenges in AEC design projects
* **Learn** how to use Autodesk's newest generative design tools such as Refinery, through practical workflows

### Why make a generative design primer?
Autodesk is working to democratise technologies that can help designers in the AEC industry automate design option creation and optimise those designs to achieve better outcomes. 

These technologies require new skills and new ways to think about design, so we identified a primer would help explain new generative design terms, ideas and methods, and inspire users to explore them with Autodesk tools. 

designtech.io was commissioned to kick-start the development of this primer, we thank them for all their efforts in establishing this valuable resource.
