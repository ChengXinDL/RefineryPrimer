# The Generative Design Primer

## About
Welcome to the Generative Design Primer, which aims to introduce AEC practioners of all experience levels to the exciting field. This primer will help you:

* **Understand** what generative design is by defining the base concepts and terminology you need to know
* **Explore** how these techniques can be used to solve practical challenges in AEC design projects
* **Learn** how to use Autodesk's newest generative design tools such as Refinery, through practical workflows


In the midst of this activity and exciting opportunity for working with Dynamo, we need a document of the same caliber, the Dynamo Primer.

This Primer includes chapters developed with Mode Lab. These chapters focus on the essentials you will need to get up and running developing your own visual programs with Dynamo and key insights on how to take Dynamo further. Here's what you can expect to learn from the primer:

* **Context** - What exactly is "Visual Programming" and what are the concepts I need to understand to dive in to Dynamo?
* **Getting Started** - How do I get Dynamo and create my first program?
* **What's in a Program** - What are the functional parts of Dynamo and how do I use them?
* **Building Blocks** - What is "Data" and what are some fundamental types I can start using in my programs?
* **Geometry for Design** - How do I work with geometric elements in Dynamo?
* **Lists, Lists, Lists** - How to do I manage and coordinate my data structures?
* **Code in Nodes** - How can I start extending Dynamo with my own code?
* **Computational BIM** - How can I use Dynamo with a Revit model?
* **Custom Nodes** - How can I create my own nodes?
* **Packages** - How can I share my tools with the community?

This is an exciting time to be learning about, working with, and developing for Dynamo. Let's get started!

### Why make a generative design primer?
Autodesk is working to democratise technologies that can help designers in the AEC industry automate design option creation and optimise those designs to achieve better outcomes. 

These technologies require new skills and new ways to think about design, so we identified a primer would help explain new generative design terms, ideas and methods, and inspire users to explore them with Autodesk tools. 

designtech.io was commissioned to kick-start the development of this primer, we thank them for all their efforts in establishing this valuable resource.

### Open-Source
This Primer is an open source project initiated by the Generative Design teams at Autodesk and we’re dedicated to providing high-quality content on generative design through this primer.  

Contributions are of course welcomed and can take many shapes: 

* you can report any issue you may have found on our [issues page]( https://github.com/DynamoDS/GenerativePrimer/issues) 

* if you’d like to add or edit sections of the Primer itself, please head over to [our Github repository (https://github.com/DynamoDS/GenerativePrimer) 

* have an example workflow of generative design ? Head over to [our contribution guidelines (https://github.com/DynamoDS/GenerativePrimer/CONTRIBUTING.md) and see how you can add it to the Community examples section
