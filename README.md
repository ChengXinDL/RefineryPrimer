# The Generative Design Primer

## About
Welcome to the Generative Design Primer, which aims to introduce AEC practitioners of all experience levels to an exciting new approach to design. This primer will help you:

* **Understand** what generative design is by defining the base concepts and terminology you need to know 
* **Explore** how these techniques can be used to solve practical challenges commonly found in AEC design projects
* **Learn** how to use Autodesk’s newest Generative Design tools such as Refinery, through practical workflows

### Why make a generative design primer?
Autodesk is working to democratise technologies that can help designers in the AEC industry
automate the creation of design options and  optimise those designs to achieve better outcomes.

Using these technologies requires new skills and new ways to think about design. We created this generative design primer to explain  the terminology, ideas and methods you will need to understand to  begin using the Autodesk tools that support this new approach to design.

designtech.io was commissioned to kick-start the development of this primer, we thank them for all their efforts in establishing this valuable resource.
