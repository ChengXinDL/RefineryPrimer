Optimization is an inherently mathematical subject. It is concerned with maximizing or minimizing some mathematical function to arrive at the best possible solution to a problem. Optimization problems arise in all kinds of fields, from aerospace engineering to architectural design, but regardless of domain, every optimization problem has three features: 

1. An objective function 
2. Constraints 
3. Data
