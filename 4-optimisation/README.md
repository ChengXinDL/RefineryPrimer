# Optimization

![What Is Optimization Start](../.gitbook/assets/4-01_whatisoptimisationstart.png)

Optimisation is an inherently mathematical subject. It is concerned with maximising or minimising some mathematical function to arrive at the best possible solution to a problem. Optimisation problems arise in all kinds of fields, from aerospace engineering to architectural design, but regardless of domain, every optimisation problem has three features:

1. An objective function 
2. Constraints 
3. Data
