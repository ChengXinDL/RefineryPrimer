# Evaluators

An evaluator (also known as a discriminator), is fed potential solutions from the generator and evaluates how good or bad these solutions are. Evaluators are a natural analogue of the objective and fitness functions outlined in [section 4-08](#what-do-you-mean-by-‘fitness’?). In a generative building design, an evaluator may be a function that describes the average amount of sunlight a façade will be exposed to over a year. 

In design, evaluators must be specified mathematically, they must output a number that can be used to discriminate between solutions. 

_need an image here.  Suggest using the 3Box example as a thread here - you could show the volume and surface area measurement nodes as evaluators to explain. Lilli can provide images._
