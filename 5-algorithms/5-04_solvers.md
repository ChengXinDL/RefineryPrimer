# Solvers

A solver is an algorithm specifically designed to find the solution to a precisely defined problem. If you pass the solver a problem of the right form, it will use built-in procedures to find you a solution. This means that the designer doesn’t have to do all the calculations herself. 

Solvers typically require inputs to take a very specific form. Often, the greatest challenge is defining your problem in a way that a solver can understand. To take a simple example, your phone’s calculator is a solver for addition, subtraction, and division – but it only works if you punch things in correctly.
