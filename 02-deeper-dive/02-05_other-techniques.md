# Are There Examples of Other Techniques That Could Be Used to Solve This Problem?

<img src="../assets/deeper/othertechniques.png" style="width:200px;"/>

There are many techniques that can be used to tackle a Computational Design problem. In addition to the genetic algorithm, other examples include: 

- Solving with pen and paper 
- Manual guess and check 
- Set packing or partitioning algorithms 
- Gradient descent  
- Stochastic (aka Random) Local Search and then filtering results to desired maximum, minimum, or median values.
- Linear, Integer, or Quadratic programming  

Some of these techniques are quite basic and easy to implement (see [Optioneering section](02-02_optioneering.md)), others are far more sophisticated. Choosing the right technique for your application is a tricky question and much more of an art than a science. Often, it comes down to the precise design question you are tackling and your familiarity with a given technique.
