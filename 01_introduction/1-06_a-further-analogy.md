# A Further Analogy

Let’s say you’re looking to fly from London to New York, so you go to your favourite flight-comparison website and ask it to find you the cheapest direct flight.

What happened in the background is the system: 

* person sets goals: direct flights only & lowest cost
* computer generates a list of all possible routes from London to New York (it already knows scheduled flights of every airline)
* computer evaluates each of the identified routes based on your goals
* computer attempts to solve your goals and returns the list of flights, with most suitable ones first
* person evaluates the list of best options and makes a choice (faster and better than if they had to do all of this work on their own)

Though stretching the analogy a bit, this example exhibits the steps found in a generative design workflow.
