# A Further Analogy

Let’s say you’re looking to fly from London to New York, so you go to your favourite flight-comparison website and ask it to find you the cheapest direct flight.

What happened in the background is the system: 

* person  sets goals: direct flights only & lowest cost
* computer generates a list of all possible routes from London to New York (it already knows scheduled flights of every airline)
* computer evaluates each of the identified routes based on your goals
* computer attempts to solve your goals and returns the list of flights, with most suitable ones first
* person evaluates the list of best options and makes a choice (faster and better than if they had to do all of this work on their own)

Though stretching the analogy a bit, this example exhibits the steps found in a generative design workflow.

A similar approach can be taken to building workflows, take for example the Autodesk MaRS office in Toronto:

* people set goals:  adjacency, daylighting, distraction etc….
* people design algorithms: that can flex a floor plan in defined ways
* people designs algorithms: that measures how different floor plans perform against stated goals
* computer flexes model and measures each design: it keeps running different iterations of the design until it gets as close as possible to the specified goals
* people evaluate: the best options that are returned (there are many because there were multiple options set) and use this best set of options to make design decisions
