# Why should I use Generative Design?

In a nutshell, generative design is a goal-driven approach to design that uses automation so that designers and engineers 
* have better insight  
* can make faster & more informed design decisions  

### Faster
Generative Design aims to help a designer find “better” designs for his or her project faster. This is done by exploiting algorithms and other computer-based techniques that enable a machine to quickly generate and evaluate a huge number of design variants on the fly.

## More Variation
Your specific design parameters are defined to generate many—even thousands —of potential solutions in only a fraction of the time it would take any person. 

For example, it is not uncommon for an algorithm to generate a thousand variants or more in under a minute. A human may be able to generate three solid variants in a week. Computational Designers can hang their hats on the fact that at least one of these thousand variants will as good (low cost, full of natural light, easily constructible, etc.) or better than what a human could come up with.

## Better
You tell the software the results you want. With your guidance it arrives at the optimal design along with the data to prove which design performs best. 

An important point to note is that a Generative Design algorithm will rarely generate a single output, it will almost always generate a wide range of outputs from which the user can choose. That is, it doesn’t choose for the user, instead it gives the user a list of things to choose from.  

To kick off a Generative Design, a user specifies a list of parameters that the design must satisfy; it must fit within a certain floorplate, it may not exceed certain dimensions, it must cost no more than a certain amount to construct, etc. The algorithm gets to work and quickly begins returning designs that are consistent with these rules. In this way, the real-world limitations and constraints a designer faces are directly taken as inputs in the generative process.
