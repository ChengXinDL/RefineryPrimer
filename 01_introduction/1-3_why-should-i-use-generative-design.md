# Why should I use Generative Design?

In a nutshell, generative design is a goal-driven approach to design that uses automation so that designers and engineers
* have better insight into their designs
* can make faster & more informed design decisions 
* can explore more options using the computer to help




### Faster
Generative design aims to help a designer find “better” designs for his or her project faster. This is done by exploiting algorithms and other computer-based techniques that enable a machine to quickly generate and evaluate a huge number of design variants on the fly. 

### More Variation
Your specific design parameters are defined to generate many—even thousands —of potential solutions in only a fraction of the time it would take an individual designer.

For example, it is not uncommon for an algorithm, once created, to generate a thousand variants or more in under a minute. A human may be able to generate three solid variants in a week. Computational Designers can hang their hats  on the fact that at least one of these thousand variants will be good (low cost, full of natural light, easily constructible, etc.) or different than what a human could come up with in the same amount of time

### Better
You tell the software what results you want. With your guidance it produces sets of optimal designs along with the data to prove which design performs best against your pre-defined goals.

### Note
An important point to note is that a generative design algorithm will rarely generate a single output, it will almost always generate a wide range of outputs from which the user can choose. That is, it doesn’t choose for the user, instead it gives the user a list of things to choose from.  
 
To kick off a generative design, a user is essential to the process. By specifing a list of parameters that the design must satisfy; it must fit within a certain floorplate, it may not exceed certain dimensions, it must cost no more than a certain amount to construct, etc, the approach is able to augment humans with computer power. The algorithm gets to work and quickly begins returning designs that are consistent with these rules. Only with well-structured logic and a clearly designed algorithm will the computer be able to produce quality outputs. In this way, the real-world limitations and constraints a designer faces are directly taken as inputs in the generative process.
