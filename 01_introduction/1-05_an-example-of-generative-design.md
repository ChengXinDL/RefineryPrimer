# An Example of Generative Design

Letâ€™s look at several examples that illustrate how generative design can help you achieve your design challenges.

### Product Design

Consider the example of designing a typical, four-legged table. Using a standard approach, a designer would manually define the height, width, depth & material of the table, and the resultant output would be a single, physical object with a fixed, immutable form. Perhaps the designer tests several distinct sets of dimensions & material combinations and ends up with three or four table prototypes.

In the generative approach, the designer would instead specify: 

* a range of permissible values for each dimension 
* a series of available materials and their properties (such as cost) 
* a set of goals that measure how successful a table design is 

The designer would then use the computer to help him/her generate a series of designs falling within the specified range. Some designs will be short and wide, others will be tall and thin, but each will be consistent with the user-defined parameters. This is key, dozens of designs can be generated in an instant, much more than any human could feasibily examine, so that the best ones can easily be identified.

As you can see, this describes a fairly generic process, which is why there are so many possible applications of generative design, in areas as diverse as aviation, automotive and building design, manufacturing, and product design.
