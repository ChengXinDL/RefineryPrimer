# What is Computational Design?

Computational Design can be an elusive concept to define, but we can say for certain it is not any one algorithm or off-the-shelf process you can apply. Rather, we can describe it as the approach whereby a designer defines a series of instructions, rules, and relationships that precisely identify the steps necessary to achieve a proposed design and the resulting data or geometry. Crucially, these steps must be computable, meaning they can be understood & calculated by a machine.  

Put simply, computers are very good at performing calculations and executing pre-defined steps. When approaching a design computationally, the procedure used to create the design is the output of a designerâ€™s work, not the resulting object itself. As such, the churn of generating project geometry and data are offloaded to a machine, saving time, money, and effort, and letting the designer focus on the creativity of the design process itself.
