# A Further Analogy

Let’s say you’re looking to fly from London to New York, so you go to your favourite flight-comparison website and ask it to find you the cheapest direct flight.

What happened in the background is the system: 

* formulates your goals: direct flights only & lowest cost 

* generates a list of all possible routes from London to New York (it already knows scheduled flights of every airline) 

* evaluates each of the identified routes based on your goals 

* attempts to solve your goals and returns the list of flights, with most suitable ones first 

Though stretching the analogy a bit, this example exhibits the steps found in a generative design workflow.
