# What is Refinery?

Project Refinery is Autodesk’s latest generative design application that allows users to explore, evaluate, and optimize their Dynamo designs. Refinery achieves this by allowing users to set multiple (and sometimes, competing) design goals, generates a series of feasible solutions, and enables the user to make decisions by automating the creation and evaluation of designs as instructed.

The key feature of Project Refinery is that it drives a design towards optimality, handles all the back-end work of generation and iteration and presents to the user the single design that aligns most closely with his or her goals.


As a technical note, Refinery: 

* allows a user to leverage Dynamo Package Manager and run custom nodes (including Python nodes)
* runs locally on a user’s computer 
* will run in Dynamo for Revit or Dynamo Sandbox
* includes a node to caches Revit or other external data without the need to rely on external processes that could be expensive computationally.


Project Refinery is currently available as a Beta release, as of January 2019.
