# What is Visual Programming?

Visual Programming is a form of coding that, unlike textual programming, does not require familiarity with a textual programming language (like C# or Python), and instead uses a visual interface where a user connects small blocks of pre-defined functionality. Together, these blocks form a larger network of functionality that can achieve complex goals. This approach is easier to learn and makes accessible to everyone tasks that were previously reserved to expert coders.  

 
Recently there has been a significant shift in the AEC industry towards Visual Programming. These tools are becoming commonplace in many organizations, especially as the move away from traditional CAD tools accelerates. While there will always be a place for CAD tools, Visual Programming applications enable a new approach to design. Design need no longer be a series of static modelling operations, but rather a dynamic, customisable flow of tasks.
