# What goes into a Generative Design Process?

As we saw above, a generative design approach involves several distinct steps. The types of methods used in each step are very different to each other, so we generally categorise them as follows : 


| Step | Algorithm Type |
| --- | --- |
| generation of new design studies | generators |
| evaluation of each study | evaluators |
| ranking & solution achieves goal | solvers |
