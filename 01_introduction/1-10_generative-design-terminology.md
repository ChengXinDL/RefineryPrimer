# Generative Design? Terminology

[Insert text]


**Computational design**
/ comp·u·ta·tion·al de·sign /
noun

> Explicit rules that systematically model the behavior of a proposed design and the resulting data and geometry. Little project data is kept as static objects, instead the procedure to create them is saved. Project geometry and data are generated from the execution of mathematical and logical procedures.


**Generative design**
/ gen·er·a·tive de·sign /
noun

> A system that produces design studies (alternatives), evaluates them against quantiﬁable goals, improves studies by learning from previous, and ranks results based on their distance from the goals. The project is kept as a system, with affordances to choose one or a small subset of alternatives as a ﬁnal set of project data and geometry.
